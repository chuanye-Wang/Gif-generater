# Gif-generater

#### A simple git creater utilizing Python
I considered to ues C++ and Qt todevelop it, maybe next time
However, some of function didnt show in the gif below. 

e.g., you can config the "Frame Rate" and "Downsampling Parameter" for some space saving.

This gif was generated by the Generater itself.
